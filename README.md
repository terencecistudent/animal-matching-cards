# Animal Matching Card Game

### Description
This is an animal matching card game where there are twelve cards lined out 4x3 (4 across and 3 down).  The aim
is to click on a card which will flip over, then click on another card to see if it will match.  Once the user has
matched all of the cards there will be a pop up saying 'Congratulations'.  There is a button above the game container
which allows the user to restart the game.

This game is also browser cross compatible.

### RoadMap
Plans I have to implement in this game in the future:
- To add a timer counting down from 1 minute or
- To create a timer counting up.
- To show to number of moves the user has made.
- To add more photos of animals to create a bigger and enjoyable user experience.
- To create a nicer layout and smoother transactions.
- To add sound effects or music relevant to the theme.
